# slides

This is a first venture into using Flutter to develop multi-platform desktop apps.

Why do slideshow apps always go full-screen?


About Page
----------
The file 'assets/about.json' can be used to set certain values in the About screen:

    {
        "emailTo" : "toWhomm@whereareyou.com",
        "emailSubject" : "What is the subject?",
        "emailBody" : "DEFAULT BODY",
        "websiteIntro" : "Visit this website....",
        "website" : "https://whatismywebsite.com",
        "coffeeText" : "Please, please buy me coffee",
        "coffee" : "https://buymeacoffee.com/mickeyid"
    }

If any values are missing then default 'harmless' values are used.
